After reading [Learn You A Haskell For Greater Good](http://learnyouahaskell.com)
I kept asking myself a question: *Is it possible to write an Android game in
a functional manner, with minimum or no state?*. While writing a stateless
game model was a no-brainer I still cannot find an elegant way of performing
nice transitions between states (such as animations). This is why the result
is somewhat simple in means of graphic design, but still quite playable.
