It's a long time since I started my work on translation of
[Learn You a Haskell for Great Good](http://learnyouahaskell.com)
by Miran Lipovaca. And while it's still work in progress, the next chapter
just got shipped!

From *Chapter 2* you can learn about types and typeclasses in Haskell.
Pretty basic stuff, but definately worth reading if you're just starting
the functional ride.

The Table of contents currently looks like this:

  1. [Introduction](|filename|/lyahfgg/00-Introduction.html)
  2. [Starting Out](|filename|/lyahfgg/01-Starting-Out.html)
  3. [Believe the Type](|filename|/lyahfgg/02-Believe-The-Type.html)

Wow! Ten more to go!

As always you are more than welcome to read, share, download and report
errors (the more the better)!
