Yeah, that's right, the uber-awesome book
[Learn You a Haskell for Great Good](http://learnyouahaskell.com) by Miran
Lipovaca just got itself a Polish translator.

You can already grab the
[introduction](|filename|/lyahfgg/00-Introduction.html)
and [first chapter](|filename|/lyahfgg/01-Starting-Out.html)
dealing with some basic stuff like function calls, lists and tuples. Feel free
to proofread it as many times as you want and point as many mistakes as you
wish (the more the better!).

I expect to translate one chapter every 1-2 weeks, so check out for updates.
I currently plan on translating 10 first chapters, because I feel like
I need some more time to grasp monads, and other hight level stuff.
No worries -- they're pretty much covered in the original version of the book.
