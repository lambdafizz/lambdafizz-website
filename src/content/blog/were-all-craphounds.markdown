It's been a long time since the last post on my page, so it's just about time to
put some sweet gifts on the net. This time it's not related to programming, so if
you are here for hardcore coding action you can skip this one.

I've just finished Polish translation of [Cory Doctorow's](http://craphound.com)
**"Craphound"**. Just in case you don't know - he's an author of kick-ass sci-fi
stories and novels. If you like "Craphound", make sure you visit his webpage
[craphound.com](http://craphound.com) for more goodies. By more I mean a **whole
lot of good stuff**.
